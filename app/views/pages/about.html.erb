      <p class="">I live in the mountains of Colorado where I enjoy mountain biking and skiing, particularly xc skiing. I'm a former professional XC mountain biker and member of the U23 national mountain team. In 2016 I attended Turing School of Software and Design to pursue my passion for computer science and writing code. Later that same year I began work at Roaring Fork Internet Users Group(rof.net) working as the sole web developer and IT technician.
    Since Turing, I also have worked as a freelance web developer/software engineer, architecting applications throughout the entire app lifecycle, focussing on testing, coding, debugging and even hosting. Starting in the fall of 2020, I started working full time as a full stack engineer for PatientsLikeMe. When not working, I'm usually out riding my bike or skiing and playing in the mountains.</p>
